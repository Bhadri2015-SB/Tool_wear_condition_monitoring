# Tool_wear_condition_monitoring

The project highlights the significance of tool wear monitoring in ensuring the quality of machined products. Traditional methods involve sensors and cameras, which can be costly and intrusive. The research proposes a machine learning approach aligned with Industry 4.0 automation to address these challenges. By analyzing the sound produced during machining, the researchers aim to estimate tool wear without interrupting the process.




## Features

A list of features included in your project.
